The dataset I am using contains data on different krill species that were found in the central California Current Ecosystem from 2004 to 2022. These data were obtained from the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies (ACCESS) program.
These data include:
- names of the cruises
- year and month of collection
- 15 species of krill found in the central California Current Ecosystem. All of these fields are the counts of each of the species found in the Tucker samples in each cruise.

- North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Website: http://www.o3d.org/npgo/npgo.php
- Oceanic Niño Index: this index uses the same region as the Niño 3.4 index, and it uses a 3-month running mean to classify El Niño (below -0.5) or La Niña (above 0.5) events. Website: https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/nino-sst-indices-nino-12-3-34-4-oni-and-tni
- Coastal Upwelling Transport Index: this is the monthly values averaged for latitude degrees 37 and 38. Website: https://mjacox.com/upwelling-indices/
- Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index: this is the monthly values averaged for latitude degrees 37 and 38. Website: https://mjacox.com/upwelling-indices/
- Monthly upwelling indices (averaged for 36°N and 39°N). Negative values indicate less upwelling, and positive values indicate more upwelling. Website: http://www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/PFEL/modeled/indices/upwelling/NA/upwell_menu_NA.html
