# Krill-project2
The goal of this project is to analyze the distribution of Euphausia pacifica (one of the most important krill species) in the central California Current Ecosystem from 2005 and 2022 in relation to six ocean and climate indices that are associated with water temperature and upwelling, two known factors that affect krill distribution.
